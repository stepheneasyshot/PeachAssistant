/**
 * To use SFSpeechRecognizer, you first need to request authorization from the user to access speech recognition. Then, you create an SFSpeechRecognizer object and configure it with a Locale. You can then either use an SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest for live audio or an SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest for audio files. Finally, you initiate the recognition process using the recognitionTask method.
 * Here's a more detailed breakdown:
 * 1. Request Authorization:
 * Before using the SFSpeechRecognizer, you must request authorization from the user to use speech recognition. This is done using the requestAuthorization() method on the SFSpeechRecognizer object. The first time you request authorization, the system will prompt the user to grant or deny access. Subsequent requests will return immediately with the previously recorded results.
 * 2. Create an SFSpeechRecognizer Object:
 * Code
 *
 * let speechRecognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer(locale: Locale(identifier: "en-US"))
 * This creates an instance of the SFSpeechRecognizer class, specifying the language to use for speech recognition (e.g., "en-US" for American English).
 * 3. Configure and Prepare Recognition Request:
 * You can either use an SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest for live audio or an SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest for audio files. SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest (for live audio).
 * Code
 *
 *     let recognitionRequest = SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest()
 *     recognitionRequest.shouldReportPartialResults = true // Optional: Enable partial results
 * This creates a request object for live audio recognition. The shouldReportPartialResults property determines whether intermediate results are reported. SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest (for audio files).
 * Code
 *
 *     let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "sample", withExtension: "mp3")!
 *     let recognitionRequest = SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest(url: url)
 * This creates a request object for recognizing speech from an audio file.
 * 4. Initiate Recognition:
 * Code
 *
 * speechRecognizer.recognitionTask(with: recognitionRequest) { (result, error) in
 *     // Handle the recognition result or error
 *     if let result = result {
 *         // Access the recognized text: result.bestTranscription.formattedString
 *     } else if let error = error {
 *         // Handle the error
 *     }
 * }
 * This starts the speech recognition task. The completion handler will be called with the recognition result or an error.
 * Example with AVAudioEngine (live audio):
 * Code
 *
 * let audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()
 * let recognitionRequest = SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest()
 * recognitionRequest.shouldReportPartialResults = true
 *
 * speechRecognizer.recognitionTask(with: recognitionRequest) { (result, error) in
 *     if let result = result {
 *         print(result.bestTranscription.formattedString)
 *     } else if let error = error {
 *         print(error)
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // ... Set up audio engine and capture audio from microphone ...
 * // Add audio data to the recognition request using append(_:) or appendAudioSampleBuffer(_:)
 * // ...
 * Key Considerations:
 * Audio Input:
 * For live audio, you'll typically use AVAudioEngine to capture audio from the microphone and then append the audio data to the SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest.
 * Pauses:
 * The SFSpeechRecognizer may clear the transcription after a pause (e.g., 1-2 seconds). If you need continuous speech recognition with pauses, you might need to adjust the recognition task configuration or implement custom handling.
 * Partial Results:
 * Enabling shouldReportPartialResults on the recognition request will provide intermediate results as the speech is being recognized.
